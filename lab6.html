	<h2> A Summarized History of Computers </h2>
	
	<h3>The First Digital Computers</h3>
	
	<p> 
		The first digital computer was called the ENIAC, which stands for Electronic Numerical Integrator And Calculator. It was created at the <br>
		University of Pennsylvania for military research funding and its main purpose was to quickly calculate trajectories for artillery shells. <br>
		It could only run one program at a time, which had to be fed into the computer as a sequence punch cards. <br><br>
		
		In the 1960s, the not so mini Minicomputers were created. They were about the size of a refrigerator, and affordable enough for most <br>
		universities. They had multiple terminals, which consist of a keyboard and monitor, but didn't have their own processors. The beneficial <br>
		thing about Minicomputers was that different people could run programs on the same computer at the same time. If multiple programs were <br>
		running, the minicomputer would share the processor cycles among the different programs. <br><br>

	<h3>The First Desktop Computers</h3>
	
	<p>
		
		The first desktop computers became available during the late 1970s and early 1980s. The first one, called the Apple II, was created in <br>
		1977. Apple computers, which later went on to be called Mac, was the first computer to feature a Floppy Disk Drive, Mouse, and Windows <br>
		Graphical User Interface. <br><br>
		
		The second desktop computer called IBM PC was created in 1981. It used Microsoft's DOS Operating System. Microsoft eventually patents <br>
		the term Windows, and in 1985 Windows 1.1 was released.  <br><br>

	<h3>Computers Today</h3>
		
	<p>
		Computers today have become so advanced that they are small enough to fit in our pockets through phones, and on our wrists as watches <br>
		and fitbits. They are even embedded in our everyday appliances like TVs, refrigerators, kitchen tools, and cars. Each computer, in <br>
	    all of its forms, contains its own processor. This shows how far we have come because even the much bigger Minicomputers didn't have <br>
		their own processors. <br><br >
		
		The leading creators of computers today are Apple, Google, and Microsoft, each of which specialize in either <br>
		or some of desktop, tablet-like, and mobile computing. <br><br>
